Core Framework
BasePlugin Abstract Class (base_plugin.py):

Define a common interface for all plugins, including essential methods like initialize, execute, and shutdown.
Include lifecycle hooks like before_execute and after_execute for additional flexibility.
Provide utility methods that can be useful across different plugins (e.g., logging and configuration parsing from yaml).


PluginRegistry (plugin_registry.py):

Implement registration functionality to add plugins to the system dynamically.
Enable deregistration or unloading of plugins, allowing for dynamic updates or removals.
Support lazy loading of plugins, initializing them only when their functionality is first required.
Facilitate discovery of plugins, including automatic detection of plugins within the plugins/ directory.
Allow for execution of plugin functionality based on user input or system events.
Implement error handling and logging mechanisms to manage and report issues arising from plugin operations.
Provide mechanisms for managing plugin dependencies and conflicts.


Plugin Implementation
Individual Plugin Directories (e.g., plugin_one/):
Ensure each plugin is implemented as a concrete class inheriting from BasePlugin, overriding necessary methods.
Include a config.yaml or similar configuration file for each plugin to define its specific settings, parameters, and dependencies.
Implement plugin-specific initialization logic, considering any required setup steps and resource allocations.
Define the core functionality within the execute method or other custom methods specific to the plugin's purpose.
Support cleanup and resource release in a shutdown or cleanup method to ensure graceful termination.

Utilities and Support
Utilities (util/):
Develop common utility functions that plugins might need, such as configuration file parsing, logging setups, or network utilities.
Include support for plugin-specific logging configurations, allowing plugins to log independently of each other and the core system.


General System Requirements
Configuration and Customization:

Enable global configuration settings that affect the plugin system's overall behavior (e.g., plugin discovery paths, logging levels).
Allow for per-plugin configuration, enabling customization of plugin behavior without altering the plugin code.

Security and Isolation:

Ensure the plugin system includes security measures to prevent malicious or poorly written plugins from compromising the system.
Consider implementing sandboxing or other isolation techniques for executing plugin code, especially when running untrusted or third-party plugins.
Documentation and Examples:

Provide comprehensive documentation covering the architecture, usage, and extension of the plugin system.
Include example plugins demonstrating common use cases (cli plugin to display a table of  information, cli plugin to combine common tasks into one), implementation patterns, and best practices.
Testing and Validation:

Implement unit and integration tests for the core components of the plugin system to ensure reliability and stability.
Encourage plugin developers to include tests for their plugins, facilitating easier integration and maintenance.
